# Example of Fitting out EM Systematics / Selection For Bright Siren Measurements

A simple toy example that shows in principle how you would fit out EM
systematics / selection effects in a "bright siren" measurement like those
discussed, for example, in [Abbott, et al.
(2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551...85A/abstract) or [Chen
(2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvL.125t1301C/abstract).
